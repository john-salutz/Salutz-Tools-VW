### Installation

Follow Vectorworks installation procedures to install the .zip file
via the plug-in manager. After a restart of Vectorworks this should
make the objects available for use in the Vectorworks Workspace editor.<br>
[Vectorworks Help: See Creating Plug-in>Third-party Plug-ins>Install](https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2020/eng/VW2020_Guide/Scripts/Creating_scripted_plug-ins.htm#XREF_89724_Creating_Scripted)

After installing and restarting, add the tools to your workspace
layout for use. They will be found in the "Tools" tab, under
"Salutz Tools".<br>

### Usage

Use them for whatever you can think of! I developed them for my
personal use, but if you find them helpful, that's great!

The source code can be viewed via the Vectorworks Plug-in Manager, or
in your local user folder for Vectorworks Plug-ins, in the *Salutz
Tools/src* folder.

As detailed in the License below, this is free and open source
software. Please edit and remake it to your heart's content. If you do
create something interesting, or make a tool that runs more
effectively, please shoot me a message to let me know, I will likely
be interested!

Please exercise good judgment regarding re-naming the tools. If you
have clearly made a new thing and release it, an attribution would be
nice but re-naming the tool to something other than *"\<tool name\>
(Salutz)"* would be appreciated. That way they can be understood as
separate things.
