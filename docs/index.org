  Salutz Tools are a series of un-encrypted, free and open source Vectorscript Plug-In Objects for use in Vectorworks software, primarily for use by theatrical designers and technicians. \\

  All objects have normal Vectorworks parameters for X & Y coordinates and rotation. Objects must be on the Layer Plane (not Screen Plane) to use the Z coordinate. \\

  See [[https://github.com/john-salutz/Salutz-Tools-VW][README]] file for installation and license information.

* RackObject Object
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: RackObject
  :END:
** Description
   ~RackObject~ is a point-object for drawing 19" A/V racks for mounting gear. Built to interface with ~RackEquip~ plug-in objects. ~RackObject~ will re-draw/re-size based on the ~Number of Rack Spaces~ parameter.
{{{dualImg(RackObject)}}}
** User Editable Attributes
*** Fill/Pen
	Sets the attributes of the frame around the Rack Object. ~Pen~ also sets the color of the ~Rack Name/ID~ text.
*** Text
	Font attributes of the ~Rack Name~ can be changed by altering the text attributes of the object via the Text menu or the Format Text box. The space numbers are affected by the changes in typeface, but no other attributes including size because they are scaled to fit in 1 rack space to avoid overlap.

* Survey 3D Object
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Survey3D
  :END:
** Description
   ~Survey 3D~ is a point-object that allows the user to calculate one or two points in 3D space based on measurements (likely taken with a laser distance meter) in order to locate hanging positions or architectural features in 3D space while only having access to a limited amount of a stage deck.

   - Measurement point placements can be set to negative values to flip the side of the origin point on which they are placed.

   - Make sure ~Vectorworks Preferences>Display>Display 3D Loci~ is set correctly to allow the result points to display properly in 3D.

   - Result points will not be drawn until all related measurements and distances have non-zero values.

   - It is not recommended to rotate the object. While the point may still be drawn correctly in space, the measurements and coordinates will not be accurate.

	   - ~Measure 1~ is set at the origin of the object.
	   - ~Measure 2~ is set on the Y-axis on the opposite side of ~Measure 1~ from the result points.
	   - ~Measure 3~ is set on the X-axis if ~Measurement Style~ is set to ~Off Axis~.

**** Off Axis
	 This style uses all three ~Measure~ points, and can locate result points that are anywhere in 3D space with a Z-height greater than the ~Measure~ points.
*** Number of Result Points
	Choices: ~1~ or ~2~. The ~2~ points can be useful when trying to describe multiple points on an object without having to re-measure. Examples would be the two ends of a hanging pipe or the two extreme sightlines of a balcony seating area.

* Menu Commands
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: MenuCommands
  :END:
  These are included to help with workflow when using the Salutz Tools Plug-in Objects and integrating with Worksheet reports.\\

** Refresh Selected
   Refreshes the selected objects on the active layer with the ~ResetObject~ command. Particularly useful for getting out-of-date plug-in objects to update.\\

** Refresh Worksheets
   Refreshes and recalculates the selected worksheets on the active layer. While there is a right-click menu item for "Recalculate" and menu items for "Recalculate Active" or "All Worksheets" in the worksheet editor, this exists to quickly recalculate multiple worksheets with a simple select and menu command from the main drawing.\\
   This also allows for custom keyboard shortcuts.\\

** Refresh Section VP
   Refreshes all Section and Elevation Viewports in the entire drawing.\\

   *Use with caution* Depending on rendering options for the various viewports, this process could take a very long time. Generally most useful when dealing with a drawing with multiple Section/Elevation Design Layer Viewports (particularly referencing other files), this menu command can be a time-saver if run right after opening the file.

** UnFlip Selected
   Checks selected text, symbol, and plug-in objects on the active layer to see if their ~Flip~ state is true, and if so removes the ~Flip~. This is particularly useful if you have Mirrored a collection of plug-in objects and want them to maintain their original orientation.

** Hydra
   Initiates a hotkey process for switching/setting classes, layers and saved views. Once placed in the workspace this command can have a keyboard shortcut defined to make the process simpler.

*** Syntax / Tags
	In order to be recalled by ~Hydra~, Layers and Classes must have a Tag assigned to them with the syntax *"Hydra-"* followed by the single keyboard key the user wishes to use to recall that Layer or Class.

	Saved Views must have *"Hydra-<key>"* somewhere in their name.

	*NOTE:* Only one resource may be assigned to a particular key. Having multiple resources tagged with the same key can lead to unexpected results.

*** Step 1: Calling the ~Hydra~ Command
	The ~Hydra~ command must be added to a menu in the workspace in order to be used. It can also have a keyboard shortcut assigned. On a Mac I've found that Command-semicolon is unused by Vectorworks and is fairly ergonomic.

	The *<Escape>* key may be pressed at any time to cancel the command.

*** Step 2: Select Command type
	Type a single key to select the action to perform. This is case-insensitive.

**** L : Switch active layer to chosen layer

**** C : Switch active class to chosen class

**** S : Assign selected objects to chosen class

**** V : Recalled Saved View

*** Step 3: Choose resource
	Type a single key to select the resource (Layer, Class, Saved View) assigned to that key. If no resource is assigned, ~Hydra~ will deliver an error message.
